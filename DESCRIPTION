Description: 
  Providing the kubernetes-like class 'ManagedCloudProvider' as a child class of 
  the 'CloudProvider' class in the 'DockerParallel' package. The class is able to
  manage the cloud instance made by the non-kubernetes cloud service.
  For creating a provider for the non-kubernetes cloud service, the developer
  needs to define a reference class inherited from 'ManagedCloudProvider' and
  define the method for the generics runDockerWorkerContainers(),
  getDockerWorkerStatus() and killDockerWorkerContainers(). For more information, please see
  the vignette in this package and <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DockerParallel>.
